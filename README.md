## Project info

For any business to run they require many layers of suppliers (That are at times across the globe).
Sometimes, there can be supply disruptions for various reasons:  Such as vehicle breakdown or a factory shuts down etc.
In such cases the companies are left blindsided, since they only interact with direct suppliers.
